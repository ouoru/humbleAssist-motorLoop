#Humble Assist
- The humble assist is a Sit <-> Stand (STS) Assist for Seniors. This is a common technology due to muscle loss as the body ages, where the elderly lack core and lower body strength to safely sit and/or stand.
- This technology is commonly seen in hospitals and nursing homes, which require assistance from the nurse for the mechanism to be safe. These lifts lift 100% of the body load, over a long period of time (20 seconds +)
- Our team noticed that in many cultures (we have a diverse team!), grandparents are NOT sent to nursing homes, but prefer to live at home with the family. As a result, they throw themselves onto chairs / couches, and ask for family members to help them up. This commonly leads to bone fractures.
